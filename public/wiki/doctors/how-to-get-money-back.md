# How to get money back

In Luxembourg you normally get an appointment, visit the doctor, pay for the services, then you send a letter to CNS Centre Nationl de Santé, 
they reimbourse you (_first time you should send as well your banking details_). Last step usually being a letter with response from CNS and copy of 
the invoice from the doctor sent to private insurance, if you have it.

Now here are the details

1. Send the original invoice and proof of payment to CNS, [here you can find the updated address](https://cns.public.lu/en/assure/vie-privee/depenses-sante/avance-frais/en-pratique.html)
  1. The address at the moment of writing of this article: 
    * Caisse nationale de santé, Service Virements, L-2980 Luxembourg, Luxembourg
1. Couple of days later, or up to 2 weeks, you'll get a letter with details of reimboursement and money in the bank account
